title: Bill Weiss| Systems, Networks, Security
---

Hi there! This is the semi-professional website of Bill Weiss, a
systems and operations type currently in Chicago, IL. I know it's not
much to look at: notice the above list doesn't say designer.

I'm always promising myself that I'll put something more in this
space. This is a second step: now it's not an Apache directory index,
AND it's not just raw HTML inexpertly laid down by hand.  I'm using
[MiddleMan](http://middleman.com/) to maintain the thing.

In the meantime, you can find me in a bunch of places:

 * On [ServerFault as BillWeiss](http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss)
 * At [Backstop Solutions Group](https://www.backstopsolutions.com/), my day job.
   "bill" at that domain will reach me, as well lots of administrative addresses.
 * On [GitHub as BillWeiss](https://github.com/BillWeiss)
 * Via email tons of places, but preferably "bv" at this domain

Things I'm interested in, and will start writing about here at some
point:

 * Systems and operations, especially the DevOps world
 * Automation of the same
 * Management of the same, and the people who do them
 * Security of networks, systems, people... anything and everything

I've got a GPG key if you like that sort of thing.  Email address is the one above.<br />
The key ID: <code>5D055836</code><br />
Fingerprint: <code>4B15 D741 D64D 55BF 52AA 2221 75A9 6570 5D05 5836</code><br />
The entire file is here: [bweiss.asc](http://www.clanspum.net/~houdini/bweiss.asc)

I have an old key, ID <code>0AD234B0</code>, which has been revoked.  Nothing
nefarious happened, I just lost access to it.

I, in fact, can take Bitcoin, though I don't know what I'm doing with
it: <code>1GdZKQWspkUbdqFdBHcNQumiBxPFNmV1GA</code>.  Don't pay anything you owe me
via this address, but if you want to throw a couple of bucks in, go
ahead :)
