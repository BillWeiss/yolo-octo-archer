title: Bill Weiss| Systems, Networks, Security
---

Hi there! This is the semi-professional website of Bill Weiss, a
systems and operations type currently in Portland, OR. I know it's not
much to look at: notice the above list doesn't say designer.

I'm always promising myself that I'll put something more in this
space. This is a second step: now it's not an Apache directory index,
AND it's not just raw HTML inexpertly laid down by hand.  I'm using
[MiddleMan](https://middlemanapp.com/) to maintain the thing.

In the meantime, you can find me in a bunch of places:

 * On [Twitter as BillWeiss](https://twitter.com/BillWeiss/)
 * On [ServerFault as BillWeiss](http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss)
 * At [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), my day job.  "bV" at that domain will reach me.
 * On [GitHub as BillWeiss](https://github.com/BillWeiss)
 * Via email tons of places, but preferably "bv" at this domain

Things I'm interested in, and will start writing about here at some
point:

 * Management!  I'm currently super happy managing a team of SREs here at Puppet.
   Managing machines and systems is kind of fun too, but people, man.
 * Systems and operations, especially the DevOps world
 * Automation of the same
 * Security of networks, systems, people... anything and everything

I've got a GPG key if you like that sort of thing.  Email address is the one above.<br />
The key ID: `0x75A965705D055836`<br />
Fingerprint: `4B15 D741 D64D 55BF 52AA  2221 75A9 6570 5D05 5836`<br />
The entire file is here: [bweiss.asc](http://www.clanspum.net/~houdini/bweiss.asc)

There's another attached to my work address.<br />
The key ID: `0xEE1540F03379956C`<br />
Fingerprint: `7CE0 77DB 6D06 EF1C F7E6  2427 EE15 40F0 3379 956C`

I have an old key, ID `0AD234B0`, which has been revoked.  Nothing
nefarious happened, I just lost access to it.

I, in fact, can take Bitcoin, though I don't know what I'm doing with
it: `1GdZKQWspkUbdqFdBHcNQumiBxPFNmV1GA`.  Don't pay anything you owe me
via this address, but if you want to throw a couple of bucks in, go
ahead :)
