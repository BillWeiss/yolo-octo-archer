<p>
    Hi there! This is the semi-professional website of Bill Weiss, a
    systems and operations type currently in Chicago, IL. I know it's not
    much to look at: notice the above list doesn't say designer.
</p>

<p>
    I'm always promising myself that I'll put something more in this
    space. This is a second step: now it's not an Apache directory index,
    AND it's not just raw HTML inexpertly laid down by hand.  I'm using
    <%= link_to "Middleman", "http://middleman.com/" %> to maintain the
    thing.
</p>

<p>
      In the meantime, you can find me in a bunch of places:
  <ul>
    <li>On <%= link_to "Serverfault as BillWeiss", "http://serverfault.com/users/4117/bill-weiss" %></li>
    <li>At <%= link_to "Backstop Solutions Group",
        "https://www.backstopsolutions.com" %>, my day job.  "Bill" at that
        domain will reach me, as will logs of admin-related addresses.</li>
    <li>On <%= link_to "GitHub as BillWeiss",
    "https://github.com/BillWeiss" %></li>
    <li>Via email tons of places, but preferably "bv" at this domain</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Things I'm interested in, and will start writing about here at some
  point:
  <ul>
    <li>Systems and operations, especially the DevOps world</li>
    <li>Automation of the same</li>
    <li>Management of the same, and the people who do them</li>
    <li>Security of networks, systems, people... anything and everything</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I've got a GPG key if you like that sort of thing.<br />
  Email address is the one above.<br />
  The key ID: <code>5D055836</code><br />
  Fingerprint: <code>4B15 D741 D64D 55BF 52AA 2221 75A9 6570 5D05
  5836</code><br />
  The entire file is here: <a
  href="http://www.clanspum.net/~houdini/bweiss.asc">bweiss.asc</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I have an old key, ID <code>0AD234B0</code>, which has been revoked.  Nothing
  nefarious happened, I just lost access to it.
</p>

<p>
  I, in fact, can take Bitcoin, though I don't know what I'm doing with
  it: <code>1GdZKQWspkUbdqFdBHcNQumiBxPFNmV1GA</code>.  Don't pay anything you owe me
  via this address, but if you want to throw a couple of bucks in, go
  ahead :)
